Addon is backported and ready to release.



To-Do List:
Add Alt+Right click on header to go in manual filtering (if that header already has some configs, it should go into that config, instead of general manual filtering tab.)?	
Add currencies module (badges,honor & arena points and other)
Need to make dropping an item into bag menu "Manual Filtering" section automatically add item to the field of "item", so you dont have to paste it there.
Need to make manual filtering by dropping item without pressing enter or at least show the "okay" button after item was dropped.
Update new item highlight border to modern style.
Add Reset positions of anchor to menu frame.
BagSearch - Hide ItemLevel for grayed items.
